# Gregtech - Skyblock Edition
GSE is a lightweight Skyblock modpack focused around GTCEu and Ex Nihilo with some QoL mods

## Building
You will need to have python3 and python requests (`pip3 install requests`) installed.
To build run `python build/main.py` in command line.

#### Note: updating external mods
To update external mods, you need to download the updated version and run `python build/getHash.py <mod location>` 
and copy the output to the `hash` field for the mod in `mainifest.json`

#### - Fork Update [By Fork Creator]
Regarding the quest book not showing quests.. take the DefaultQuests.json from the previous version on the main branch and copy it into the betterquesting config folder.. should fix the issue
{Edit}
Nevermind.. it's now sorted in the release v3.0.1
